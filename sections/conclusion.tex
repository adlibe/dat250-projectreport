\section{Conclusions}

Our goal with this project was to develop a simple poll application with an entire application stack. In addition it was our goal to evaluate our chosen featured technology, Elm. Though we did encounter some issues. Primarily that due to time constraints, we failed to stitch together the final application stack into a valid docker image. We did manage to implement all the discrete elements of our application. In addition we were able to evaluate our featured technology, though our hypothesis did not end up holding much water. Though this can teach us about the importance of actually evaluating our assumptions about a chosen technology, instead of simply relying upon the statistics we have available.
